# OpenAi Discord Bot Project


[OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction) recently released an API with multiple powerful models, and since i have a big interest in AI, i decited to build a small project around it using ```GPT-3: (A set of models that can understand and generate natural language) and 'text-davinci-002': Most capable GPT-3 model ```. So i built a discord bot that does 2 main things.

1. Understand natural language (eg. ask a question and get an answer)
2. Generate an image (eg. describe an image and get it generated)


# Try Bot 
I will be hosting the bot online soon for people to try out, in the meantime you can join my discord [server](https://discord.gg/cmDChyUEXB) and let me knwo you wanna try it, or you can download the code locally and get an [API key](https://openai.com/api/) and a [discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
